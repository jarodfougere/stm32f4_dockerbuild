## README ##

This folder contains drivers I've written for bare metal
peripherals on stm32f411xE microcontroller.

Unfortunately, due to the development complexity of a USB
CDC class driver, using ONLY bare metal drivers for the
firmware is not a feasible solution given the time and 
resources allocated for the project.
